# It turns out git and bazel pkg_tar and a bunch of other things fail if we

# We're making a fake world-writable one *inside* the container so that the
# entrypoint can write an entry to it with the user matching the host user
# this means we don't need to run the container as root! :-)
# We care about not running as root because it means build files are owned by
# the host users, not root (and logs, etc).
