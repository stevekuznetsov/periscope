# boskos


## Background
[βοσκός](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B2%CE%BF%CF%83%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%82) - shepherd in greek!

boskos is a resource manager service, that handles and manages different kind of resources and transition between different states.

## Introduction

Boskos is inited with a config of resources, one JSON entry per line, from `-config`

A resource object looks like
```go
type Resource struct {
	Type       string    `json:"type"`
	Name       string    `json:"name"`
	State      string    `json:"state"`
	Owner      string    `json:"owner"`
	LastUpdate time.Time `json:"lastupdate"`
}
```

Type can be GCPProject, cluster, or even a dota2 server, anything that you want to be a group of resources.
Name is a unique identifier of the resource.
State is a string that tells the current status of the resource.

## API

###	`POST /acquire`

Use `/acquire` when you want to get hold of some resource.

#### Required Parameters

| Name    | Type     | Description                                 |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `type`  | `string` | type of requested resource                  |
| `state` | `string` | current state of the requested resource     |
| `dest`  | `string` | destination state of the requested resource |
| `owner` | `string` | requester of the resource                   |

Example: `/acquire?type=gce-project&state=free&dest=busy&owner=user`.

On a successful request, `/acquire` will return HTTP 200 and a valid Resource JSON object.

###	`POST /release`

Use `/release` when you finish use some resource. Owner need to match current owner.

#### Required Parameters

| Name    | Type     | Description                                |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `name`  | `string` | name of finished resource                  |
| `owner` | `string` | owner of the resource                      |
| `dest`  | `string` | destination state of the released resource |

Example: `/release?name=k8s-jkns-foo&dest=dirty&owner=user`

###	`POST /update`

Use `/update` to update resource last-update timestamp. Owner need to match current owner.

#### Required Parameters

| Name    | Type     | Description                    |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| `name`  | `string` | name of target resource        |
| `owner` | `string` | owner of the resource          |
| `state` | `string` | current state of the resource  |

Example: `/update?name=k8s-jkns-foo&state=free&owner=user`

###	`POST /reset`

Use `/reset` to reset a group of expired resource to certain state.

#### Required Parameters

| Name     | Type          | Description                                         |
| -------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`   | `string`      | type of resource in interest                        |
| `state`  | `string`      | current state of the expired resource               |
| `dest`   | `string`      | destination state of the expired resource           |
| `expire` | `durationStr` | resource has not been updated since before `expire` |

Note: `durationStr` is any string can be parsed by [`time.ParseDuration()`](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration)

On a successful request, `/reset` will return HTTP 200 and a list of [Owner:Resource] pairs, which can be unmarshalled into `map[string]string{}`

Example: `/reset?type=gce-project&state=busy&dest=dirty&expire=20m`

###	`GET /metric`

Use `/metric` to retrieve a metric.

#### Required Parameters

| Name   | Type     | Description                |
| ------ | -------- | -------------------------- |
| `type` | `string` | type of requested resource |

On a successful request, `/metric` will return HTTP 200 and a JSON object containing the count of projects in each state, the count of projects with each owner (or without an owner), and the sum of state moved to after `/done` (Todo). A sample object will look like:

```json
{
	"type" : "project",
	"Current":
	{
		"total"   : 35,
		"free"    : 20,
		"dirty"   : 10,
		"injured" : 5
	},
	"Owners":
	{
		"fejta" : 1,
		"Senlu" : 1,
		"sig-testing" : 20,
		"Janitor" : 10,
		"None" : 20
	}
}
```

## Config update:
1. Edit resources.json, and send a PR.

1. After PR is LG'd, make sure your branch is synced up with master.

1. run `make update-config` to update the configmap.

1. Boskos updates its config every 10min. Newly added resources will be available after next update cycle.
Newly deleted resource will be removed in a future update cycle if the resource is not owned by any user.

## Other Components:

[`Reaper`] looks for resources that owned by someone, but have not been updated for a period of time, 
and reset the stale resources to dirty state for the [`Janitor`] component to pick up. It will prevent 
state leaks if a client process is killed unexpectedly.

[`Janitor`] looks for dirty resources from boskos, and will kick off sub-janitor process to clean up the 
resource, finally return them back to boskos in a clean state.

[`Metrics`] is a separate service, which can display json metric results, and has HTTP endpoint 
opened for prometheus monitoring.

For the boskos server that handles k8s e2e jobs, the status is available from the [`Velodrome dashboard`]


## Local test:
1. Start boskos with a fake resources.json, with `go run boskos.go -config=/path/to/resources.json`

1. Sent some local requests to boskos:
```
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/acquire?type=project&state=free&dest=busy&owner=user'
```

## K8s test:
1. Create and navigate to your own cluster

1. `make deployment`

1. `make service`

1. `kubectl create configmap projects --from-file=config=projects`

1. `kubectl describe svc boskos` to make sure boskos is running

1. Test from another pod within the cluster
```
kubectl run curl --image=radial/busyboxplus:curl -i --tty
Waiting for pod default/curl-XXXXX to be running, status is Pending, pod ready: false
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
[ root@curl-XXXXX:/ ]$ curl 'http://boskos/acquire?type=project&state=free&dest=busy&owner=user'
